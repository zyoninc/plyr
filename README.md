Meteor Wrapped Plyr
=====================

[Selz/Plyr](http://plyr.io/)
We wanted a lightweight, accessible and customisable media player that just supports modern browsers.
Sure, there are many other players out there but we wanted to keep things simple, using the right elements for the job.


### Installation

With Meteor 0.9 and above, install using:

```sh
$ meteor add zyon:plyr
```
